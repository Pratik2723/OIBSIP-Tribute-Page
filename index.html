            <p class="xy"> <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam </b> was an Indian aeronautical scientist who served as the country’s 11th president from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in the city of Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, where he went on to study physics and aerospace engineering.

                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency, now in Tamil Nadu. Kalam was the youngest of five siblings. 
                
                His ancestors had been affluent traders and landlords, owning enormous property holdings. Kalam’s family was impoverished in his early youth. Apart from the ancestral home, the family fortune and assets were lost with the building of the Pamban Bridge. The family came to be known as “Mara Kalam Iyakkivar” (later on reduced to “Marakier”), meaning wooden boat steerers, as the main family business was ferrying pilgrims. Kalam sold newspapers to support his family financially.
                
                APJ Abdul Kalam, the missile man of India and the former president, continues to be an inspiration to many people of all ages and from all backgrounds. His commitment to science and technology and his service to the country earned him the title “Missile Man of the Country.” The majority of individuals consider him to be their true inspiration.</p>
